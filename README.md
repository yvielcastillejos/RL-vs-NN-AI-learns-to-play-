# RL-vs-NN-AI-learns-to-play-

In this repository, we will learn what the difference is when it comes to training a game with a Neural Network vs training a game with Reinforced Learning using Q-tables.

For the Neural Network approach, we train a model with batched datasets gathered from the environment. We get the following:

The graph is noisy due to the small batch size. This does not affect the essence of what the graph is trying to convey, however.
